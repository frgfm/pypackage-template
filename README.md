# Template for Python packages


Kicking off a Python package project? Why not starting with a high-quality basis?


## Quick Tour

### GitHub template

GitHub allows you to [create a repository using a template](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template). In order to do so, click on "Use this template" (or [here](https://github.com/frgfm/pyproject-template/generate)) and follow the instructions.


### Cookie cutter

Templating Python projects is now very accessible thanks to [CookieCutter](https://github.com/cookiecutter/cookiecutter). You can use this template easily by using the following command:

```shell
cookiecutter pypackage-template/
```

The command will interactively ask you to fill some information to generate the project.


## Setup

Python 3.6 (or higher), [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) and [Git](https://git-scm.com/) are required to run this project.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/frgfm/pypackage-template.git
pip install -r pypackage-template/requirements.txt
```

## Contributing

Feeling like I missed a fancy new feature that is worth adding to all Python packages? Any sort of contribution is greatly appreciated!
